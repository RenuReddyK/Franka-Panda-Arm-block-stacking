# Franka-Panda-Arm-block-stacking

The objective of this project was to design a robust solution to enable the Franka Emika Panda arm to perform the task of Pick and Place in a fast and safe manner.

Main areas of focus: Perception, IK solver algorithm, Orientation Filtering Tracking, Trajectory planning, Gripping, Stacking methods â€“ static and dynamic blocks.

The following report presents a complete strategy and mathematical derivation for this task, along with a detailed analysis with different test cases that were conducted on simulation and on hardware.
